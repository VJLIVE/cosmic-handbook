# Hono Middleware Guide

## Introduction

Middleware in Hono allows you to process requests before they reach the route handler. Itâ€™s commonly used for:

### Creating Custom Middleware

A middleware function takes a **Context** **(c)** and **next()** function.

```ts
app.use("*", async (c, next) => {
  console.log(`Incoming request: ${c.req.method} ${c.req.url}`);
  await next(); // Call next middleware/handler
});
```

This logs every request before passing it to the route.

### Adding CORS Middleware

For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

```ts
import { cors } from "hono/cors";

app.use("*", cors());
```

This allows requests from any origin.

```ts
app.use("*", cors({ origin: "https://example.com" }));
```

To allow specific origins:

### Authentication Middleware

A JWT-based auth middleware example:

```ts
import { jwt } from "hono/jwt";

app.use("/dashboard/*", jwt({ secret: "your-secret-key" }));

app.get("/dashboard", (c) => {
  return c.text("You are authenticated!");
});
```

This protects **/dashboard/\*** routes using JWT authentication.
If the token is invalid or missing, it blocks access.

### Role-Based Authorization Middleware

Extend authentication with role-based access:

```ts
const authMiddleware = async (c, next) => {
  const user = c.get("user"); // Assume user info is stored
  if (user?.role !== "admin") {
    return c.text("Forbidden", 403);
  }
  await next();
};

app.get("/admin", authMiddleware, (c) => {
  return c.text("Welcome, Admin!");
});
```

Only users with role: **"admin"** can access **/admin**.

### Global vs. Route-Level Middleware

Global Middleware: Affects all routes.

```ts
app.use("*", (c, next) => { ... });

```

Route-Level Middleware: Affects specific routes only.

```ts
app.get("/secure", authMiddleware, (c) => c.text("Secure Data"));
```

### Conclusion

Middleware in Hono is lightweight and flexible, making it easy to handle authentication, logging, and security.
