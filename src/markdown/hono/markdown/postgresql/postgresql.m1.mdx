# Getting Started with PostgreSQL

## Introduction & Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL (often called **Postgres**) is a powerful, open-source, and **highly extensible relational database**. It is known for its **performance, strict SQL compliance, and advanced features** that make it ideal for **enterprise applications, large datasets, and complex queries**.

### Why Choose PostgreSQL Over MySQL?

PostgreSQL provides **better scalability, indexing, and ACID compliance** than MySQL. It is particularly useful when working with **highly relational data**, **complex transactions**, or **large-scale applications**.

## Installation & Setup

To start using PostgreSQL, you first need to install it on your system.

### Install PostgreSQL on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
