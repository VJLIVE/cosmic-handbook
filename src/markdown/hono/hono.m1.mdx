# Getting Started with Hono

## Introduction & Why Hono?

Hono is a lightweight, fast, and edge-optimized web framework for JavaScript and TypeScript. It is designed for _high performance_ and is particularly well-suited for _serverless environments_ like Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Bun.

### Why Choose Hono Over Express?

Hono offers a _faster and more optimized_ approach to handling HTTP requests compared to Express. It is particularly useful for modern _edge computing_ environments.

## Installation & Setup

To start using Hono, you first need to install it via npm:

### Install Hono via npm:

sh
npm install hono

### Now, let's create a simple server using Hono

This basic setup initializes a new Hono application and defines a single route (/) that returns "Hello, Hono!". The c parameter represents the context object, which allows you to handle requests and responses efficiently.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello, Hono!"));

export default app;
```

### Key Differences Between Hono & Express

Hono is often compared with Express, as both are used to build web applications and APIs. However, there are key differences:

| Feature     | Hono                        | Express                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Performance | Extremely fast (~2x faster) | Moderate                     |
| Middleware  | Uses a simple chain model   | Uses _next()_ function       |
| Edge Ready  | Yes (Cloudflare, Deno, Bun) | No                           |
| Type Safety | First-class TypeScript      | Requires extra configuration |
| Routing     | Similar to Express          | Traditional Express routes   |

Hono is ideal for serverless APIs and edge deployments, whereas Express is better suited for traditional server-based applications.

### Running the App in Node.js

If you want to run Hono on Node.js, use a compatible server like Vercel or @hono/node-server:

```sh
npm install @hono/node-server
```

Then create a server file:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello, Hono!"));

serve(app, (info) => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${info.port}`);
});
```

Run it using:

```sh
node server.js
```
