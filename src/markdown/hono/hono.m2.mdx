# Hono Routing Guide

Routing in Hono is simple and efficient, following a syntax similar to Express.js. It supports:

## Basic Routing

Hono uses **.get()**, **.post()**, **.put()**, and other HTTP methods to define routes.

Example:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello, Hono!"));

export default app;
```

Here, the "/" route responds with "Hello, Hono!"

## Dynamic & Named Parameters

You can define dynamic routes using **:paramName**.

```ts
app.get("/user/:id", (c) => {
  const userId = c.req.param("id");
  return c.text(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

When a request is made to /user/42, it responds with "User ID: 42".

### Nested Routes

For better structuring, you can nest routes inside a Hono instance.

```ts
const user = new Hono();

user.get("/", (c) => c.text("User List"));
user.get("/:id", (c) => c.text(`User ID: ${c.req.param("id")}`));

app.route("/user", user);
```

Now, the following routes work

GET /user → Returns "User List"

GET /user/123 → Returns "User ID: 123"

### Wildcard Routes

Use \* to match any path after a certain prefix.

```ts
app.get("/docs/*", (c) => {
  return c.text("Docs Page");
});
```

/docs/setup → Matches

/docs/api/intro → Matches

### Route Groups & Middleware

Group routes together and apply middleware at a higher level.

```ts
const api = app.basePath("/api");

api.get("/products", (c) => c.json({ products: ["Laptop", "Phone"] }));
api.get("/orders", (c) => c.json({ orders: [123, 456] }));
```

Now,

/api/products → Returns a JSON list of products

/api/orders → Returns a JSON list of orders

### Conclusion

Hono's routing system is simple yet powerful, supporting nested routes, parameters, wildcards, and middleware. You can now organize your API efficiently!
