# Getting Started with OpenCV

## Introduction & Why OpenCV?

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an **open-source computer vision and machine learning library**. It provides a vast collection of functions for **image processing, video analysis, machine learning, and deep learning**. OpenCV is widely used in applications like **face detection, object tracking, and real-time image analysis**.

### Why Choose OpenCV Over Other Image Processing Libraries?

OpenCV is highly optimized for performance and can run efficiently on **CPUs, GPUs, and specialized hardware** like Raspberry Pi. It supports **C++, Python, Java**, and other languages, making it versatile for different applications.

## Installation & Setup

To start using OpenCV, you first need to install it via pip:

### Install OpenCV via pip:

```sh
pip install opencv-python
```

For additional functionalities like GPU support and contrib modules:

```sh
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

### Now, let's create a simple OpenCV program

This basic setup loads an image and displays it using OpenCV.

```python
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread("example.jpg")

# Display the image
cv2.imshow("Image", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Key Differences Between OpenCV & PIL/Scikit-Image

OpenCV is often compared with **PIL (Pillow) and Scikit-Image**, as all three can be used for image processing. However, there are key differences:

| Feature          | OpenCV                       | PIL (Pillow)          | Scikit-Image    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Performance      | Extremely fast (C++ backend) | Moderate              | Moderate        |
| Image Formats    | Supports many formats        | Mostly PNG, JPEG, BMP | Limited support |
| Deep Learning    | Yes (DNN module)             | No                    | Limited         |
| Video Support    | Yes                          | No                    | No              |
| GPU Acceleration | Yes (CUDA support)           | No                    | No              |

OpenCV is ideal for **real-time applications, computer vision, and machine learning**, whereas PIL and Scikit-Image are better suited for **basic image editing and analysis**.

### Running the Code

To run an OpenCV script, use:

```sh
python script.py
```

This will execute the script and open an image window.
