# Getting Started with Next.js

## Introduction & Why Next.js?

Next.js is a **React framework** that enables **server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes** with ease. It is optimized for **performance, SEO, and developer experience**.

### Why Choose Next.js Over Create React App?

Next.js provides **built-in optimizations** like automatic code-splitting, image optimization, and hybrid rendering, making it ideal for modern **web applications**.

## Installation & Setup

### Install Next.js via npx:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
