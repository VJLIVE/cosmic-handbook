# Docker Compose: Running Any Environment Locally

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and run multi-container Docker applications. Instead of manually running multiple `docker run` commands, you can define all your services (containers), networks, and volumes in a single `docker-compose.yml` file and run everything with just one command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Why Use Docker Compose?

Simplifies multi-container applications – Define everything in one file.

- Easy to share & replicate – Just share the docker-compose.yml file.
- Handles networking automatically – No need to configure ports manually.
- Supports environment variables – Configure different setups for dev, staging, and production.
- Reproducibility – Start and stop entire environments with a single command.

### Installing Docker Compose

Docker Compose is included in `Docker Desktop`. You can check if it’s installed by running:

```sh
docker-compose --version
```

## Understanding docker-compose.yml

The `docker-compose.yml` file is a configuration file where we define our application’s containers, networks, and volumes. Let’s break down a basic example.

#### Example:

Let's assume we have a Node.js app that needs:

- A web server

- A PostgreSQL database

Instead of running multiple docker run commands, we define everything in one file:

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    image: node:18
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    working_dir: /app
    command: "node server.js"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:15
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  pg_data:
```

- Terminology:

`version: "3.8"` → Specifies the Docker Compose version.

`services`: → Defines multiple containers.

`app`: → The Node.js application container.

`image: node:18` → Uses the official Node.js image.

`volumes`: → Mounts the current directory to /app in the container.

`working_dir`: → Sets the working directory inside the container.

`command`: → Runs the Node.js server.

`ports`: → Maps port 3000 of the host to port 3000 of the container.

`depends_on`: → Ensures the `db` service starts before the `app` service.

- This file defines two services: `app` (Node.js) and `db` (PostgreSQL). The `app` service depends on the `db` service, ensuring that the database is up before the application starts.

- This when run will create a network for the containers to communicate with each other. And run the app and db containers at ports 3000 and 5432 respectively.

### Running the Containers

To start the entire setup:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

`-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

To check running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

#### Example Output:

```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
abcdef123456   nginx     "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   10 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds    80/tcp    pesky_haibt
```

### Stopping and Removing Containers

To stop all running containers (app and db):

```sh
docker-compose down
```

To sto a specific container:

```sh
docker-compose stop app
```

### Managing Logs & Debugging

View logs of all running services

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

`-f`: Follows the logs in real-time.

Check logs for a specific service:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f app
```

`-f` -> Follows the logs in real-time.

Restart a single service:

```sh
docker-compose restart app
```

### Scaling Services

Want multiple instances of the web server? Scale it up with:

```sh
docker-compose up --scale app=3 -d
```

Now 3 containers will run for the app, distributing traffic.

### Conclusion

- Docker Compose makes it easy to manage multiple containers with one command.
- It ensures consistent environments and allows scaling with minimal effort.
- It’s essential for local development, CI/CD pipelines, and microservices.

Next: We'll explore how to use docker-compose.yml to run databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and Kafka inside containers.
