# Deploying Docker Containers

Once your application is containerized, the next step is to **deploy it** to the cloud so others can access it.

In this module, we’ll walk through the most common and beginner-friendly deployment options:

## Option 1: Push to Docker Hub

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a public registry for storing and sharing images.

### Step-by-step

#### 1. Log in to Docker

```sh
docker login
```

#### 2. Tag your image

```sh
docker tag my-app <username>/my-app:latest
```

Replace username with your Docker Hub username.

#### 3. Push your image

```sh
docker push <username>/my-app:latest
```

This uploads your image to Docker Hub.

## Option 2: Deploy to Railway

[Railway](https://railway.com/) lets you deploy Docker containers without worrying about infra.

### Step-by-step

- Go to railway.app

- Click New Project → Deploy from GitHub

- Choose your repo that contains a `Dockerfile`

- Railway detects and builds it automatically

- Add any environment variables if needed

- Click Deploy

## Option 3: Deploy on a VPS (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.)

You're on Windows, deploying to a remote Linux server (VPS).

#### 1. SSH into your remote VPS

```sh
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

#### 2. Pull and run your container

```sh
docker pull username/my-app
docker run -d -p 80:3000 username/my-app
```

That's it — your app is now live!

## Summary

| Method       | Best For                    | Difficulty | Docker Hub Sharing | Railway Deployment | VPS (DO/EC2) Control |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Docker Hub   | Sharing public images       | Easy       | Yes                | N/A                | N/A                  |
| Railway      | Deploying apps in minutes   | Easiest    | Limited            | Yes                | Limited              |
| VPS (DO/EC2) | Full control + custom setup | Medium     | Yes                | No                 | Full                 |

## Conclusion

Docker is a powerful tool for containerizing applications, making them portable and easy to deploy. Whether you're sharing images on Docker Hub, deploying to Railway, or running on a VPS, the possibilities are endless. Happy coding!
