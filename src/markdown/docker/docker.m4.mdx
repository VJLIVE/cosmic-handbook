# Containerizing React and Express Applications

Now that you know how to run prebuilt services like databases using Docker, it's time to **containerize your own apps** — whether it's a frontend in React or a backend in Node.js/Express.

## Why Containerize Your App?

- Same environment everywhere — dev, staging, production.
- Simple deployment — no need to install Node.js or dependencies manually.
- Your app becomes portable, versioned, and isolated.

## 1. Containerizing a React App

Assume you have a React app created with Vite.

#### 1. Folder Structure

```md
my-react-app/
├── public/
├── src/
├── Dockerfile
├── .dockerignore
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js
```

#### 2. 🐳 Dockerfile (React)

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application

# Use the official Node.js image as a base image
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build


# Stage 2: Serve with nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built application from the builder stage to the nginx html directory
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy nginx configuration file
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Explanation:

This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build process to efficiently build and serve a React application using Nginx.

**Stage 1: Builder**

1.  **`FROM node:18-alpine AS builder`**: Uses the official Node.js v18 image based on lightweight Alpine Linux as the base for the build stage, naming it `builder`.
2.  **`WORKDIR /app`**: Sets `/app` as the working directory within the builder stage.
3.  **`COPY package*.json ./`**: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the `/app` directory.
4.  **`RUN npm install`**: Installs the React application's dependencies.
5.  **`COPY . .`**: Copies the entire React application source code into the `/app` directory.
6.  **`RUN npm run build`**: Builds the React application, generating static assets in a `build` folder.

**Stage 2: Final (Nginx Server)**

1.  **`FROM nginx:alpine`**: Uses the official Nginx image based on lightweight Alpine Linux for the final runtime image.
2.  **`COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html`**: Copies the production-ready `build` folder from the `builder` stage to Nginx's default web server directory.
3.  **`EXPOSE 80`**: Declares that the Nginx server will listen on port 80 (the standard HTTP port).
4.  **`CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`**: Starts the Nginx web server.

**In short:** This Dockerfile first builds your React app using Node.js and then uses a lightweight Nginx server to efficiently serve the generated static files from the `build` directory on port 80. No Node.js runtime is included in the final image.

#### 3. .dockerignore

```sh
node_modules
dist
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
```

#### 4. Build and Run

```sh
docker build -t my-react-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app
```

Now open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## 2. Containerizing an Express Backend

You have a basic Express API in /my-express-app.

#### 1. Folder Structure

```md
/my-express-app
├── src/
│ ├── routes/
│ ├── controllers/
│ ├── models/
│ ├── middlewares/
│ ├── utils/
│ └── index.js
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
└── .dockerignore
```

#### 2. 🐳 Dockerfile (React)

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application

# Use the official Node.js image as a base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package.json ./
COPY package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the application
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

#### Explanation:

This Dockerfile sets up and runs an Express.js application within a Docker container.

1.  **`FROM node:18-alpine`**: Uses the official Node.js v18 image based on lightweight Alpine Linux as the base.
2.  **`WORKDIR /app`**: Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container.
3.  **`COPY package.json ./` & `COPY package-lock.json ./`**: Copies dependency files first for efficient caching.
4.  **`RUN npm install`**: Installs the Express app's dependencies.
5.  **`COPY . .`**: Copies the rest of the application code into the container.
6.  **`EXPOSE 5000`**: Declares that the Express app will listen on port 5000.
7.  **`CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]`**: Specifies the command to start the Express server using Node.js.

**In short:** This Dockerfile creates a lean environment, installs dependencies, copies your Express app code, exposes port 5000, and runs your `src/index.js` file using Node.js.

#### 3. .dockerignore

```sh
node_modules
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
```

#### 4. Build and Run

```sh
docker build -t my-express-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-express-api
```

Now open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## 3. Bonus: Combine Frontend & Backend using Docker Compose

You can combine both the React frontend and Express backend into a single `docker-compose.yml` file.

This allows you to run both services together, making it easier to manage dependencies and networking between them.

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./my-react-app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./my-express-app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

Start All Services

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Now:

- React app on http://localhost:3000

- Express API on http://localhost:5000
