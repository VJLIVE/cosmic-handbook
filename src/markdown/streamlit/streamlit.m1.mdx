# Getting Started with Streamlit

## Introduction & Why Streamlit?

Streamlit is an **open-source Python framework** that makes it easy to build and deploy **data-driven web applications** with minimal code. It is widely used for **machine learning models, data visualization, and dashboard applications**.

### Why Choose Streamlit Over Flask/Django?

Streamlit offers a **faster and more intuitive** way to build interactive web apps for data science and analytics compared to Flask or Django. It is designed to be **declarative and simple**, allowing developers to focus on logic rather than frontend development.

## Installation & Setup

To start using Streamlit, you first need to install it via pip:

### Install Streamlit via pip:

```sh
pip install streamlit
```

### Now, let's create a simple Streamlit app

This basic setup initializes a new Streamlit application and displays "Hello, Streamlit!" using the `st.write()` function.

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello, Streamlit!")
st.write("Welcome to your first Streamlit app!")
```

### Key Differences Between Streamlit & Flask/Django

Streamlit is often compared with Flask and Django, as all three can be used to build web applications. However, there are key differences:

| Feature       | Streamlit                   | Flask/Django                 |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Performance  | Optimized for data apps     | General-purpose web apps     |
| Frontend     | Auto-generated UI           | Requires HTML/CSS/JS         |
| ML/AI Focus  | Yes                          | No (needs extra setup)       |
| Interactivity| Built-in widgets            | Requires manual setup       |
| Deployment   | Easy (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku) | More complex (Servers, DBs) |

Streamlit is ideal for **data-driven dashboards and ML models**, whereas Flask/Django is better suited for **full-scale web applications**.

### Running the App in Local Environment

To run a Streamlit app, use the following command:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server and open the app in your browser.
