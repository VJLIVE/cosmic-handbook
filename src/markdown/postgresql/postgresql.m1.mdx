# Getting Started with PostgreSQL

## Introduction & Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL (often called **Postgres**) is a powerful, open-source, and **highly extensible relational database**. It is known for its **performance, strict SQL compliance, and advanced features** that make it ideal for **enterprise applications, large datasets, and complex queries**.

### Why Choose PostgreSQL Over MySQL?

PostgreSQL provides **better scalability, indexing, and ACID compliance** than MySQL. It is particularly useful when working with **highly relational data**, **complex transactions**, or **large-scale applications**.

## Installation & Setup

To start using PostgreSQL, you first need to install it on your system.

### Option 1: Install PostgreSQL via Installer (GUI Method)

- Visit the official Postgres website:

- Download the installer (provided by **EnterpriseDB**).

- Launch the installer and follow these steps:

  - Select the version and installation directory
  - Set a password for the default superuser `postgres`
  - Choose default port: **5432**
  - Optionally install **pgAdmin**, the graphical interface

- Once installed, launch **pgAdmin** to manage your database visually.

### Option 2: Use Docker (CLI Method)

If you don’t want to install PostgreSQL globally, Docker is a clean and isolated way to run PostgreSQL locally.

#### Step-by-step: PostgreSQL with Docker on Windows

Make sure **Docker Desktop** is installed and running.

#### Step 1: Pull the PostgreSQL Image

```sh
docker pull postgres
```

#### Step 2: Start a PostgreSQL Container

```sh
docker run --name my-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres
```

`--name`: Gives your container a name (my-postgres)

`-e`: Sets environment variables for user/password/db

`-p`: Maps port 5432 inside the container to your local 5432

`-d`: Runs container in the background (detached)

#### Step 3: Connect to PostgreSQL

```js
import pg from "pg";
const { Client } = pg;

const client = new Client({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  user: "myuser",
  password: "mypassword",
  database: "mydatabase",
});

client
  .connect()
  .then(() => console.log("✅ Connected to PostgreSQL!"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("❌ Connection error:", err));
```

`pg`: PostgreSQL client for Node.js

`Client`: Class to create a new client instance

`connect()`: Method to establish a connection to the database

### Option 3: Use docker-compose (Recommended)

If you want to run PostgreSQL with Docker and manage it easily, you can use `docker-compose`. This allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

#### Step 1: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    container_name: my-postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

#### Step 2: Start PostgreSQL with Docker Compose

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have PostgreSQL up and running, you can start creating databases, tables, and executing queries. You can also explore advanced features like **JSONB support**, **full-text search**, and **geospatial data** with PostGIS.
