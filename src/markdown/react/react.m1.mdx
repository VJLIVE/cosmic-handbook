# Getting Started with React.js

## What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library for building user interfaces**. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update when data changes.

## Why Use React?

- **Component-Based:** UI is built using reusable components.
- **Declarative:** Describe how the UI should look, and React updates it automatically.
- **Fast and Efficient:** Uses a virtual DOM for optimized rendering.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Works with libraries like Redux, React Router, and Next.js.

## Setting Up a React Project

The easiest way to start a React project is by using Vite.

### Install Vite:

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
```

Then install dependencies:

```sh
cd my-app
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Creating Your First Component

React apps are built using **components**. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

#### `App.jsx`

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

export default App;
```

## JSX: JavaScript + XML

React uses JSX, which allows writing HTML inside JavaScript.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;
```

JSX gets converted to standard JavaScript:

```js
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Welcome to React!");
```

## Rendering Components

Components are rendered inside `index.js`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

## Summary

- React is a **component-based** UI library.
- Uses **JSX** for writing HTML in JavaScript.
- A React app is created using **Vite or Create React App**.
- Components are rendered inside `index.js`.
