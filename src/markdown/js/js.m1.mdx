# Getting Started with JavaScript

## Introduction & Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is the most widely-used programming language for building interactive websites and web applications. It allows developers to create dynamic elements on a webpage â€” such as animations, real-time updates, and form validations â€” all within the browser.

### Why Use JavaScript?

JavaScript brings your web pages to life. It works alongside HTML and CSS to create rich, responsive user experiences. It can also run on the server with tools like Node.js.

## Where Can JavaScript Run?

JavaScript runs in two primary environments:

| Environment | Purpose                        | Examples                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Browser     | Interactivity, DOM manipulation | Chrome, Firefox, Safari        |
| Server      | Backend logic, APIs            | Node.js, Deno, Bun             |

JavaScript is versatile â€” use it to build everything from simple scripts to full-stack applications.

## How to Add JavaScript to Your Website

### 1. Inline Script
Add JavaScript directly inside an HTML file:

```html
<script>
  alert("Hello, world!");
</script>
```

### 2. External Script File
Write JavaScript in a separate `.js` file and include it:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice: Place your `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag for better performance.

## Writing Your First JavaScript Program

Letâ€™s print a message to the browser console:

```js
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
```

To see this in action, open your browserâ€™s **Developer Tools** and go to the **Console** tab.

## Comments in JavaScript

Use comments to explain your code:

### Single-line Comment
```js
// This is a comment
```

### Multi-line Comment
```js
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```
